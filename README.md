### Hey! I'm [@shankjbs175](https://twitter.com/shankjbs175) (Shashank Kumar) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Student.

I have been building APIs and tools ðŸš€

I like to build things with Machine Learning, Django/Flask, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to ML and my other projects. At the same time, I'm also looking for internship or full-time opportunities. I am an active freelancer on **Upwork**, working on various projects. If you would like to have my help with your projects, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“
