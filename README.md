### Hey! I'm [@shankjbs175](https://twitter.com/shankjbs175) (Shashank Kumar) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Student.

I have been building APIs and tools ðŸš€

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, Django/flask, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to ML and my other projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an **external consultant**. If you would like to have my help with your Projects, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“
